TODO list for pysimtest (not in any specified order)

1. Make shell script more robust to handle case when it finds multiple pysimtest.py files (unlikely)

2. Make the traverse and insert function in runner be able to handle  path collisions

3. Implement dynamics launch feature

4. Add all the different dice models needed for the competition and make all of them creatable from one function
